# Securing MCP Server Access

## Introduction
This document provides guidance on securing Model Context Protocol (MCP) server access in enterprise environments. We focus on stdio protocol implementations with appropriate security controls for different use cases.

## Security Implementation Options

The selection of an appropriate security model depends on the specific operational environment, data sensitivity, and enterprise security policies. The following options cater to different scenarios:

### Option 1: Basic Security for Development & Testing
**Scenario:**
Development and testing environments where rapid iteration is prioritized but basic security controls are still required.

**Protocol Selection:** stdio
- Direct process-to-process communication
- Low latency for development workflows
- Simplified deployment for testing

**Security Requirements:**
- Basic authentication
- Minimal setup complexity
- Development-friendly implementation

**Recommended Solution:** Implement environment variable-based authentication using IdentityAsService for AppID/Secret management.

**Implementation:**
1. Register development application in IdentityAsService
2. Configure MCP server to validate credentials on startup
3. Store AppID/Secret in secure developer environment

**Rationale:** This approach provides essential authentication with minimal overhead for development workflows while maintaining enterprise credential management through IdentityAsService.

### Option 2: Enhanced Security for Shared Development VMs
**Scenario:**
Development environment where multiple developers access an MCP server running on a shared VM development server.

**Protocol Selection:** stdio
- Process isolation within shared environment
- Developer-specific access controls
- Auditing of server access

**Security Requirements:**
- Multi-user authentication
- Developer-specific permissions
- Secure credential storage
- Access logging and auditing

**Recommended Solution:** Implement file-based token authentication with developer-specific access controls and secure file permissions.

**Implementation:**
1. Create developer-specific configuration files with restricted permissions
2. Store authentication tokens in developer-specific secure locations (e.g., `~/.mcp/tokens/`)
3. Configure MCP server to validate developer identity against BlueAuth SSO (or relevant enterprise directory)
4. Implement access logging for all server operations with developer identity
5. Set up automatic token expiration with configurable timeouts

**Rationale:** This approach provides enhanced security for shared development environments where environment variables would be insufficient. Developer-specific file permissions ensure credentials remain private while enabling multi-user access on the same system.

### Option 3: Enterprise SSO Integration for HTTP Protocol
**Scenario:**
Enterprise environments where users need to authenticate to MCP servers using their existing corporate identity.

**Protocol Selection:** HTTP with TLS
- Web-standard authentication flows
- Integration with BlueAuth SSO
- Support for interactive authentication

**Security Requirements:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) compatibility
- MFA support when required by policy
- Automatic session management
- Identity federation

**Recommended Solution:** Implement OAuth 2.0/OIDC flow with BlueAuth SSO integration.

**Implementation:**
1. Configure MCP server as an OAuth 2.0 resource server
2. Integrate with BlueAuth SSO
3. Implement authorization code flow for interactive sessions
4. Set appropriate token lifetimes and refresh policies
5. Enforce MFA based on conditional access policies

**Rationale:** This approach leverages existing BlueAuth SSO infrastructure while providing a seamless authentication experience for users. It supports advanced security features like MFA and conditional access without requiring separate credential management.

### Option 4: Service-to-Service Authorization with Client Credentials
**Scenario:**
Automated systems or services that need to access MCP servers using pre-authorized client identities.

**Protocol Selection:** HTTP with TLS
- Non-interactive authentication
- Service account integration
- Scalable for multiple service clients

**Security Requirements:**
- Client identification and authorization
- Credential rotation support
- Fine-grained access control
- Audit logging

**Recommended Solution:** Implement OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with scope-based permissions.

**Implementation:**
1. Register client applications in IdentityAsService
2. Issue client_id and client_secret credentials to each service
3. Configure MCP server to validate client credentials and assign appropriate scopes
4. Implement JWT-based access tokens with service identity claims
5. Set up credential rotation schedule and monitoring

**Rationale:** This approach provides secure service-to-service authentication without human interaction. The client credentials flow supports automated processes while maintaining strong security controls and enabling detailed access management based on service identity.

## HTTP Protocol Recommendation Note
For higher security requirements (scenarios involving sensitive data or regulated environments), HTTP protocol with TLS is recommended over stdio, enabling:
- Certificate-based authentication
- Network-level security controls
- Advanced monitoring and filtering
- Integration with API gateways and security proxies
Therefore, for most production deployments or when handling sensitive information, HTTP with TLS should be the preferred approach due to its comprehensive security features and alignment with enterprise security best practices.
